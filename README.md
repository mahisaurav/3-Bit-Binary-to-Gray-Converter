3-Bit Binary to Gray Code Converter | CMOS VLSI Design
📌 Overview

This project implements a 3-bit Binary to Gray Code Converter using CMOS VLSI design methodology.
The complete design flow includes logic design, transistor-level schematic, physical layout, DRC/LVS verification, and delay–power analysis.

Both complex logic and non-complex logic implementations are designed and compared to study area, delay, and power trade-offs.
